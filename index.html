            <li>Making a homemade sponge cake was never so easy. Begin by mixing sugar and butter together. </li>
            <li> Whisk well until light and fluffy with a manual whisker or a fork. Once done, add the beaten eggs and blend well. Beat further so that the mixture turns white and creamy.</li>
            <li>Sift together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. It is done to evenly distribute the baking soda in flour.
                <ol>
                    <li>Gradually, add this to the egg mixture. If required, add a little milk and mix till the batter is fluffy and soft.</li>
                    <li>You may not add the entire milk if you feel the consistency of your cake is fine and it pours down like canned condensed milk</li>
                    <li>Add vanilla essence and blend well. Vanilla essence is important to camouflage the smell of eggs.</li>
